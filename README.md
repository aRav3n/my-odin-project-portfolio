# Packing List Website

I created this app as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. Originally I was planning to do a store inventory but thought that this packing list would be more useful for me in the future.

# Personal Website

This is my personal website that I crafted for displaying my portfolio. All my web development learning up to this point has been via The Odin Project and I am very grateful. This site will showcase my projects to show potential clients and employers what my capabilities are.
